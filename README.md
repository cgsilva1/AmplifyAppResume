# AmplifyAppResume - CRGOMEZ

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/crgomez/AmplifyAppResume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/crgomez/AmplifyAppResume/)

CRGOMEZ is built using AWS Amplify Hosting, providing a fully managed CI/CD service for fast, secure, and reliable static serverless web apps.

## Amplify Hosting Features
- Amplify Hosting supports the common SPA frameworks, for example, React, Angular, Vue.js, Ionic, and   Ember, as well as static site generators like Gatsby, Eleventy, Hugo, VuePress, and Jekyll.
- Manage production and staging environments for your frontend and backend by connecting new branches.
- Connect your application to a custom domain.
- Instant cache invalidations ensure your app is updated instantly on every code commit.
- Atomic deployments eliminate maintenance windows by ensuring that the web app is updated only after the entire deployment finishes. This eliminates scenarios where files fail to upload properly.

## Backend

CRGOMEZ uses a number of services including open source projects to work properly:
- [AWS Amplify Hosting] - Connect your Git repository to continuously deploy your frontend and backend. Host it on a globally available CDN.
- [Amplify Previews] - Previews offer a way to preview changes before merging a pull request.
- [Terraform by HashiCorp] - S3 infrastructure as code.
- [node.js] - <http://nodejs.org>
- [jQuery] - <http://jquery.com>
